	<p> For the Historical Figure Project we had to choose a historical figure in American History that has made a significant impact on the social, political and historical aspects of American Society.
We had to complete a biographical synopsis of the individual chosen and answer the driving question which was to briefly speak about how american society will be diffrent today is this individual did not succeed. 
Other components of the projects consist of primary and secondary sources to support research and findings and create an expository letter, diary entry, newspaper articles or poem using literary devices written in the 1st person to support the importance of the historical person and how they influenced American History.
At the end we were to create a website incorporating all components of this project.
