  <p> My name is Maribel Ramos and I was born in Newburgh , New York. I am currently a sophmore at <a href="http://www.newburghschools.org/schools/nfa/ptech.php">Newburgh Free Acadamey North Campus </a> and a year 2 student at Excelsior Academy. Excelsior Academy is a  P-TECH 9-14 school model that will give me an Associates Degree in Applied Science in Cyber Security or Networking and will help me begin a career .
I have been in Excelsior Academy for 2 years now and I have learned multiple things that I had no idea to do or saw myself doing someday. Coding is one of the few things I never saw myself doing two years ago when I was still in middle school. 
I have learned diffrent types of languages of coding such as HTML & CSS and Javascript. </p>
</center>
<center>
<p>I am planning to pursuit an Associates Degree in Networking and I can't wait to learn more about it. 
Some after school activities that I do is Robotics . I have been in Robotics since my first year at Excelsior and I am currently in my second year doing Robotics and I enjoy working and collaborating with all of my team members and coaches.
Other interests that I enjoy is tennis I play with some local players at a nearby park every weekend.
